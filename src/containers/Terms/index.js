    <p>
      We may use the Google AdWords or other remarketing services to advertise

      Site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t
      completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make
      an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google
      search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.{" "}

    <h5>How Do We Respond to "Do Not Track" Signals?</h5>
    <p>
      We may track your browsing behavior to better tailor suggestions and
      information for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some third party sites also keep track of your browsing activities when
      they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to
      you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can opt out of certain tracking by adjusting the settings on your
      browser. However, many websites (including the Site) may not respond to
      such signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also browser extensions that may block tracking. Again, they may
      not be effective in all cases.
    </p>
    <h5>How long do we store your information?</h5>
    <p>We intend to store your information and User Content indefinitely.</p>
    <h5>What about links to other websites?</h5>

    <p>
      We use appropriate physical, electronic, and other procedures to safeguard

      Thus, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be accessed,
      disclosed, altered or destroyed, and you accept this risk.
    </p>

      We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your
      personal information for commercial or marketing purposes.{" "}

      request or permit California customers to opt-in to, or opt-out of, this
      type of sharing.
